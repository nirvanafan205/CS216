/*
   Write a program that computes and displays the charges for a patientâ€™s hospital stay. First,
   the program should ask if the patient was admitted as an in-patient or an out-patient.
   Once the required data has been input and validated, the program should use two
   overloaded functions to calculate the total charges. One of the functions should accept
   arguments for the in-patient data, while the other function accepts arguments for out-
   patient data. Both functions should return the total charges.
